# Challenges
1. I am not sure about the code I used for the bootstrapping
2. Not sure how to interpret the β coefficients in the second question

```{r}
library(curl)
library(car)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall19/KamilarAndCooperData.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)

```



```{r before data transformations}

plot(data = d, HomeRange_km2 ~ Body_mass_female_mean)
model <- lm(data = d, HomeRange_km2~ Body_mass_female_mean)
summary(model)
plot(model)
qqPlot(model$residuals)
s <- shapiro.test(model$residuals)
s

```


## 1. Using the “KamilarAndCooperData.csv” dataset, run a linear regression looking at log(HomeRange_km2) in relation to log(Body_mass_female_mean) and report your β coeffiecients (slope and intercept).

```{r data transformation}
d$logHomeRange_km2 <- log(d$HomeRange_km2)
d$logFemaleBodyMass <- log(d$Body_mass_female_mean)
plot(data = d, logHomeRange_km2 ~ logFemaleBodyMass)
```
```{r linear model}
m <- lm(data = d, logHomeRange_km2 ~ logFemaleBodyMass)
summary(m)
```


```{r plot model}
plot(m)
```


```{r }
qqPlot(m$residuals)
```


```{r}
s <- shapiro.test(m$residuals)
s

```


```{r}
coefficients(m)
confint(m, level = 0.95)
```


```{r}
t <- coef(summary(m))
t <- data.frame(unlist(t))
colnames(t) <- c("Est", "SE", "t", "p")
t
```
## 2.  Then, use bootstrapping to sample from your data 1000 times with replacement, each time fitting the same model and calculating the same coefficients. This generates a sampling distribution for each β coefficient.

Estimate the standard error for each of your β coefficients as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution from your bootstrap and determine the 95% CI for each of your β coefficients based on the appropriate quantiles from your sampling distribution.

How does the former compare to the SE estimated from your entire dataset using the formula for standard error implemented in lm()?

How does the latter compare to the 95% CI estimated from your entire dataset?

```{r}
library(boot)
getLm<- function(dat, idx) {
  bsfit <- lm(logHomeRange_km2~logFemaleBodyMass, subset=idx, data=d)
  coef(bsfit)
}

bsReg<-boot(d, statistic = getLm, R=1000)
bsReg

boot.ci(bsReg, conf = 0.95)

summary(bsReg)
plot(bsReg)


t1 <- coef(summary(bsReg))
t1 <- data.frame(unlist(t))
colnames(t) <- c("Est", "SE", "t", "p")
t1


coefficients(bsReg)
confint(bsReg, level = 0.95)
```



```{r}

bs <- function(formula, data, indices) {
  d <- data[indices,] # allows boot to select sample
  fit <- lm(formula, data=d)
  return(coef(fit))
}

results <- boot(data=d, statistic=bs,
   R=1000, formula=logHomeRange_km2~logFemaleBodyMass)  

plot(results)

boot.ci(results)



```


```{r}

coefficients(results)
confint(results, level = 0.95)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
